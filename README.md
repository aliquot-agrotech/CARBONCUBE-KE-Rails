# CARBON ECOMMERCE BACKEND-Ruby on Rails - SETUP GUIDE

## Introduction

This repository contains a Ruby on Rails application designed for an eCommerce platform. It includes various models and relationships to manage users, vendors, products, orders, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Ruby (version 3.3.6)
- Ruby on Rails (version 8.0)
- PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LewKM/CARBON-Ecom-Rails.git
cd CARBON-Ecom-Rails
```

### 2. Install Dependencies and Setup Database

Run the following command to setup dependencies, create the database, run migrations, and seed data (if available):

```bash
bundle exec rake setup:all
```

This command performs the following tasks sequentially:

- Installs Ruby gems specified in `Gemfile` using `bundle install`.
- Creates PostgreSQL databases for development and test environments using `rails db:create`.
- Executes database migrations to set up tables using `rails db:migrate`.
- Seeds the database with initial data using `rails db:seed` (if seed data is available).

### 3. Start the Rails Server

```bash
rails server
```

The application should now be running locally. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
